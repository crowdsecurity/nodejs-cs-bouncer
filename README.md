CrowdSec is composed of a behavior detection engine, able to block classical attacks like credential brute-force, port scans, web scans, etc.

Based on the type and number of blocked attacks, and after curation of those signals to avoid false positives and poisoning, a global IP reputation DB is maintained and shared with all network members.
